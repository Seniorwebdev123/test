Want to create a pancakeswap cl one on Binance Smart chain

Steps involved

Create a token for the project
Finite supply token but integrate emission rate logic to increase the supply.
Emission-rate per blo-ck-functionality.
Smart contract for LP tokens or farming
Boost functionality for APR and API
Logic to increase and decease the API rates as per the pool liquidity
Smart contracts for single tokens or staking
Super cool aesthetic and user friendliness
Swap functionality
Planning to release the rewards in timely manner. 20% first two weeks, 20% next 4 months for stakers
Rewards program for stake holders
Ha cking prevention mechanism like fish loan attack, infinite mint attack
Add a deposit fees - I should be able to change it in the admin panel
Add a withdrawal fees - I should be able to change it in the admin panel

40% of all the fees from all swaps that occur on the platform (given to customers in USDC).

60%* of all deposit fees within the platform (40% given to customers in USDC, 20% reinvested as described directly below).

20% of all additional investments that are made outside the platform (e.g. we will be using a portion of the deposits to re-invest into low-risk stable coin investments through protocols like curve and other Stable-LP pairs).
The return from this gets added back into customers weekly dividend payout.
